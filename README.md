# Udacity_Best_In_Show

Motivation:
This project focuses on identifying common parameters associated with the smartest dogs. This analysis
was done using the best_in_show dataset found on Kaggle.

Analysis:
I initially look at their popularity to form a baseline around how many people own the smartest dogs
and then dove deeper into the analysis. A logistic regression was performed with intelligence as the 
response variable and breed category, temperment around children, grooming needs, and longevity as the
predictor variables.

The key results are listed below:
- The brightest breeds are significantly more popular than any other dog breed.
- Smarter dogs do not cost more over the course of their lifetime.
- The smartest dogs are more likely to be good with children and have higher grooming needs.
- Working and Sporting breeds are more likely to be the brightest dogs.
